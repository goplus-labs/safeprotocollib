# Web3 Safe Protocol Library

Web3 Protocol Security Library is an open-source project aimed at providing a comprehensive list of mainstream Web3 protocols and their associated smart contract addresses. The primary goal of this project is to help developers and users identify secure on-chain contract entities, thereby enhancing overall security and protecting against potential phishing attacks.

## Features

- Detailed information on mainstream Web3 protocols
- Multi-chain support (Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, etc.)
- Verified contract addresses
- Additional protocol metadata (e.g., official websites, audit reports)

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/web3-protocol-security-library.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Use the provided tools to validate or query protocol information:
   ```
   node tools/address-validator.js
   ```

## Data Structure

Information for each protocol is stored in a JSON file with the following structure:

```json
{
  "name": "Protocol Name",
  "description": "Protocol Description",
  "chains": [
    {
      "name": "Chain Name",
      "contracts": [
        {
          "name": "Contract Name",
          "address": "Contract Address"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "extra": {
    "website": "Official Website",
    "github": "GitHub Repository",
    "securityAudits": [
      {
        "auditor": "Auditor Name",
        "date": "Audit Date",
        "report": "Audit Report Link"
      }
    ],
    "tags": ["Tag1", "Tag2"]
  }
}
```
